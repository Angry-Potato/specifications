# Package metadata

The metadata can be expressed in many media types, in the package tarball it as an "Erlang term file" that can be read with [`file:consult/1`][]. This specification describes the format used in the package tarball.

## Types

All types listed here are Erlang terms.

  + `string` - A UTF-8 encoded Erlangbinary
  + `boolean` - A boolean (`true` or `false`)
  + `list(Inner)` - A list with an `Inner` type
  + `proplist(Key => Value)` - A list with two element tuples where the first element is of type `Key` and the second `Value`

Proplists are normally generic in the sense that they can have any values for keys, but they can also allow only specific keys: `proplist(...)` where the keys will be listed in relation to the type.

## Format

All keys are strings.

  + `name` (string) - Package name
  + `version` (string) - Release version, required to be a [Semantic Version][]
  + `app` (string) - OTP application name, usually the same name as the package but can differ
  + `description` (string) - Package description, recommended to be a single paragraph
  + `files` (list(string)) - Files in the package tarball contents
  + `licenses` (list(string)) - The library's licenses
  + `links` (proplist(string => string)) - Links related to the package where the key is the link name and the value is the URL
  + `requirements` (proplist(string => proplist(...))) - All dependencies of the package where the key is the dependent name
    - `app` (string) - OTP application name, usually the same name as the package
    - `optional` (boolean) - If the package is required or not
    - `requirement` (string) - [Version requirement][] on the dependent
  + `build_tools` - Names of build tools that can build the package

### Optional dependencies

An optional dependency will only be used if a package higher up the dependency chain also depends on it (only if that the dependency is not defined as optional as well).

#### Example

The package ecto have an optional dependency postgrex, if a project X depends on ecto and postgrex both dependencies will be used and ecto's version requirement on postgrex has to be satisfies. But if project X only depends on ecto the postgrex package can be ignored.
